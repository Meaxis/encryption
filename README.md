# The MMSC (MeaxisNetwork Modern Standard Cipher) / MMC (MeaxisNetwork Modern Cipher) / MMMC (MeaxisNetwork Mindly Modern Cipher) / MMMSC (MeaxisNetwork Mindly Modern Standard Cipher)
Custom encryption algorithms. Note that I do not use this on any website that store sensitive data such as passwords.

## MMSC1 (MeaxisNetwork Modern Standard Cipher)
MMC1 is my first encryption algorithm, it's just Caesar code! Available online at [this link](https://meaxis.fr/projects/cipher)!
Edit: it has came to my attention that this method is WAY EASIER to manually guess than I thought. Congratulations to *S.*, *SphinxDuke*, *P.*, *G. (that takes people to brazil)* and *J.* for guessing how it works and bringing that up to my attention!

## MMSC2 (MeaxisNetwork Modern Standard Cipher Two)
MMC2 is a little bit more complicated as it inverts the string. Available online at [this link](https://meaxis.fr/projects/cipher/cipher2.php)!

## MMSC3 (MeaxisNetwork Modern Standard Cipher Three)
MMSC3 is not publicly available as it is still used. (see picture below)
![See?! Still in use!](https://meaxis.fr/snooy.jpg) 
It uses various techniques to improve MMC2.
