# The MMSC (MeaxisNetwork Modern Standard Cipher) Project
#### Also known as: MMC (MeaxisNetwork Modern Cipher) / MMMC (MeaxisNetwork Mindly Modern Cipher) / MMMSC (MeaxisNetwork Mindly Modern Standard Cipher)
These are custom encryption algorithms. Note that I do not use this on any website that store sensitive data such as passwords.
These are made to be decipherable by an intelligent human mind. That means, in English, that it's easy enough to be deciphered by a mind.

## Research & Cause
If you're curious about the research, read this. Otherwise, scroll to get a list of the algorithms.

*(in this text, the adjective "Mindly" is used to mean "Can be understood by the educated human mind)*
Back when I had to write on paper notes during school, I always had the fear of losing them. What if someone found a paper with "MeaxisNetwork" written on it? *Context: I hate people from IRL knowing my internet presence. Only ~10 people know my internet username, 3 by mistake.*.

The algorithm needed to meet four conditions:
- [ ] Cannot be guessed by one whom has not been teached it
- [ ] Can be *mindly* written & read by those whom have been taught it
- [ ] Can be written & read by an algorithm
- [ ] Does not require additional information apart from the message itself

Thus, I needed to invent simple ciphering algorithms that would be *mindly* cipherable and decipherable. My first idea was the Caesar code, whom was slow to decipher & cipher and was unpractical. It's MMSC0.

Then came an idea from the Caméra de Surveillance : what about dividing the letters in two rows, and then referring to the letter of the other row?

Thus, on this image, A became M, B became N, Z became L... etc.

Unfortunately, this method proved rather... *uneffective*. It was so "*mindly* readable" that everyone I knew guessed how to decipher it after around 15 minutes. From the dumbest to the smartest, to the simplest of minds. All of them (refer to my MMC1 section for pseudo-credits).

Then came the MMSC2, that was still do-able from mind... but painstakingly hard. It's just a reverse of the string.
Eventually came MMSC3, which is... *uneffective* too, but differently. It's almost mindly unreadable/unwriteable. 

Eventually, one day, the holy Ciphering Method shall come to save us all. Who knows when it'll come! Will keep updating this page until then.

## MMSC1 (MeaxisNetwork Modern Standard Cipher)
MMC1 is my first encryption algorithm, it's just Caesar code! Available online at [this link](https://meaxis.fr/projects/cipher)!
Edit: it has came to my attention that this method is WAY EASIER to manually guess than I thought. Congratulations to *Shn.*, *SphinxDuke*, *Prm.*, *G[M²]. (that takes people to brazil)* and *J.* for guessing how it works and bringing that up to my attention!

### Checklist for this algorithm:
- [ ] Cannot be guessed by one whom has not been teached it
- [x] Can be *mindly* written & read by those whom have been taught it
- [x] Can be written & read by an algorithm
- [x] Does not require additional information apart from the message itself

## MMSC2 (MeaxisNetwork Modern Standard Cipher Two)
MMC2 is a little bit more complicated as it inverts the string. Available online at [this link](https://meaxis.fr/projects/cipher/cipher2.php)!

### Checklist for this algorithm:
- [x] Cannot be guessed by one whom has not been teached it
- [ ] Can be *mindly* written & read by those whom have been taught it
- [ ] Can be written & read by an algorithm
- [ ] Does not require additional information apart from the message itself

## MMSC3 (MeaxisNetwork Modern Standard Cipher Three)
MMSC3 is not publicly available as it is still used. (see picture below)
![See?! Still in use!](https://meaxis.fr/snooy.jpg) 
It uses various techniques to improve MMC2.
