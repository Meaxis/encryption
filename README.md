# encryption
Custom encryption algorithms. Note that I do not use this on any website that store sensitive data such as passwords.

## MMC1
MMC1 is my first encryption algorithm, it's just Caesar code

## MMC2
MMC2 is a little bit more complicated as it inverts the string.

## MMC3
MMC3 is not publicly available as it is still used. (see picture below)
![See?! Still in use!](https://meaxis.fr/snooy.jpg) 
It uses various techniques to improve MMC2.
